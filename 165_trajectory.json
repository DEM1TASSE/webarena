First, I need to identify all information related to reviews and add that information to memory.\n  2. Since the observations are limited each time, in order to ensure a complete collection of review information, I need to keep track of the total number of reviews and the current number of reviews viewed. This information should be stored in memory.\n  3. When the total number of reviews is equal to the current number of reviews viewed, we will stop the process. At this point, I will extract sentences from the comments in memory that are relevant to criticisms and use them as the final answer.",
